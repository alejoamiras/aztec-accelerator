# Remediation lessons — quality-audit-2026-07-24 → sechard/quality-remediation

Executing the RELEASE-BLOCKING set from `CONVERGED-SCOPE.md`. Branch off
`origin/security-hardening`. Each item validated locally (cargo fmt/clippy + touched-crate
tests; frontend build + biome; Playwright/WebDriver are CI-only) and committed.

## Codex consults

### #3 version-downgrade policy (2026-07-24, gpt-5.6-sol xhigh)
Asked: is `requested >= bundled` the right floor; reject nightly/devnet even when newer; holes
in strict-semver-parse; anything missing for a production-safe default.

Codex verdict (adopted):
- **Use `cmp_precedence`, require STRICTLY GREATER** (not `>=`): SemVer's Rust `Ord` includes
  build metadata; precedence ignores it. Exact-bundled is normalized upstream, so equal precedence
  reaching the gate is a sidegrade → refuse.
- **Reject nightly/devnet independently** — SemVer doesn't understand tiers (`5.1.0-nightly >
  5.0.0-rc.2`). Implemented as a stronger **channel rule**: above the floor, allow only stable OR
  the bundled baseline's exact prerelease channel. Subsumes dev-build rejection AND blocks
  stable→unknown-prerelease and foreign channels (`alpha`, …).
- **Reject `+build` metadata** (ambiguous precedence). Added `HasBuildMetadata`.
- Validate allowlist entries are strict semver (unit test asserts it).

Codex also recommended (NOT yet done — noted for the owner / future work): a deny/revocation
mechanism (a newer authentic release can still regress), per-network/origin local pinning so the
remote header only *selects within* local policy. Logged; out of scope for the safe default.
Rate-limit downloads / cap cache / atomic install — partially covered by existing caps + item #5.

## Pre-PR gate (whole branch, so far)
- `bun run lint` → exit 0 (one PRE-EXISTING biome warning: unused `firstCallMs` in
  `accelerator-prover.test.ts`, not from this work; warnings don't fail).
- `bun run test:typecheck` → exit 0.
- `bun run lint:actions` → clean (release-accelerator.yml change).
- Per-crate: core 185 tests + clippy + fmt clean; src-tauri crash_recovery/updater tests pass
  (sidecar-stubbed); win_acl via `cargo check --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`; tauri bin
  `cargo check --features webdriver` clean (sidecar-stubbed).
- Playwright + WebDriver = CI-only (unsupported OS locally).

## Codex consults (cont.)

### #5 updater record_pending ordering (2026-07-24, gpt-5.6-sol xhigh) — RESOLVED, must-fix
Codex's decisive finding (verified against the pinned plugin source): on **Windows**,
`tauri-plugin-updater 2.10.1`'s `install()` dispatches the external NSIS/MSI installer and
`std::process::exit(0)`s — it **never returns**. So `record_pending` in the post-install `Ok`
branch NEVER ran on Windows → the downgrade window was a CERTAINTY there, not a rare fail-open.
Must-fix, not a documentable residual.

Adopted (acting on codex's stronger argument):
- **Record intent BEFORE `install()`, fail-closed** (abort if it can't be recorded / path unresolved).
- **Retryable-intent gate**: `candidate_allowed` = strictly-above `current`+`floor` AND `>= pending`
  (equal allowed). This is why record-before doesn't poison a version — the exact intent can be
  retried; a lower still-signed version stays blocked. Codex's `artifact_id` refinement (match the
  signed artifact identity on retry, not just the version) was NOT implemented: Layer A already binds
  version→signed-artifact, so a same-version retry can only be the legitimately-signed one absent
  signing-key misuse — noted as a possible future hardening.
- On `install()` Err the intent is KEPT (an Err isn't proof no mutation happened — codex).
- **Buffering / feed-size points**: codex CONFIRMED they're correctly accepted as availability-only
  residuals #345/M6 — the plugin buffers an unbounded `Vec` then verifies minisign; bounding
  bytes-read needs the R3-rejected hand-rolled downloader (would make hand-written verify the sole
  authenticity control). Ed25519 integrity unaffected. Future fix = upstream/pinned-fork byte limits
  inside the plugin's own download+verify loop.

## Round-2 codex re-audit (2026-07-24, gpt-5.6-sol xhigh) — 7 findings, all fixed
Re-audited the whole remediation diff. Confirmed SOUND: #2 piggyback cap, #4 cache fail-closed,
#5 updater intent-before-install, #6 win_acl owner, #9 release-CI tag pin. Found + fixed:
1. **(High)** authorize Remember shipped ENABLED → pre-JS click could pre-check it. Fix: HTML
   `disabled` attr + JS `.checked=false` on init.
2. **(High regression)** version policy fail-closed on unparseable bundled BRICKED headless (no
   `AZTEC_BB_VERSION` → "unknown" → every version 403). Codex caught it. Fix: unparseable bundled ⇒
   NO floor (headless has no baseline to downgrade from); desktop always has a compile-time baseline.
   Dropped `BundledUnknown`.
3. **(Medium)** macOS: re-running the autostart plugin enable recreates the LaunchAgent plist and
   strips KeepAlive → my round-1 "skip disarm" didn't save it. Fix: `enable_transaction` skips
   `plugin_enable` entirely when `prior_enabled`.
4. **(Medium)** `focus_on_create:false` only gated a post-build set_focus; tao builds focused by
   default → queued popups stole focus. Fix: `.focused(config.focus_on_create)` on the builder.
5. **(Medium)** updater `rearm_crash_recovery_if_enabled` used `is_enabled().unwrap_or(false)` →
   a read error after disarm left recovery OFF. Fix: fail SAFE (re-arm on unreadable state).
6. **(Medium)** settings UI: `get_autostart_enabled` error rejected the whole `Promise.all`, leaving
   the switch at its false "off" default. Fix: fetch independently; on error disable + hint.
7. **(Low)** `HasBuildMetadata` 403 unreachable over HTTP (`is_valid_version` rejects `+` → 400).
   Documented (kept for direct callers).

**Meta-lesson**: codex's round-2 catch of #2 (headless brick) shows round-1's fail-closed was an
over-application — the fix for a desktop-downgrade threat mustn't brick a baseline-less mode. Also:
NEVER put backtick-wrapped tokens in a double-quoted `git commit -m` under zsh — they run as command
substitution and silently gut the message. Use `-F <file>` / heredoc.

## Notes
- `semver = "1"` was already a core dependency — no new dep.
- Only `resolve_version_flags_uncached_for_download` used a default (unknown-bundled) state with a
  real version; updated it to a proper bundled floor. No full-path prove test sends a valid
  non-bundled version, so the new 403 path doesn't disturb existing prove tests.
